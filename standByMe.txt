Made a meal and threw it up on Sunday
I've got a lot of things to learn
Said I would and I'll be leaving one day
Before my heart starts to burn

So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new
Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know?
They only seem to come and go away

Times are hard when things have got no meaning
I've found a key upon the floor
Maybe you and I will not believe
In the things we find behind the door

So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new
Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know?
They only seem to come and go away

Stand by me
Nobody knows
The way it's gonna be
Stand by me
Nobody knows
The way it's gonna be
