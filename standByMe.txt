Made a meal and threw it up on Sunday
Tengo muchas cosas que aprender
Said I would and I'll be leaving one day
Before my heart starts to burn

So what's the matter with you?
Cantame algo nuevo
Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know?
They only seem to come and go away

Times are hard when things have got no meaning
I've found a key upon the floor
Maybe you and I will not believe
In the things we find behind the door

Ent  onces, ¿qué te pasa?
Cántame algo nuevo.
¿No sabes que el frío, el viento y la lluvia no lo saben?
Solo parecen venir e irse.

Stand by me
Nadie Sabe (Revisar)
Cómo va a ser
Stand by me
Nobody knows
The way it's gonna be
